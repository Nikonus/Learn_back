# 🚀 Learn_back – Full Stack Development Workspace

A full-stack development repository focused on building scalable backend systems with a modern React frontend.

---

## 📌 About This Repository

**Learn_back** is a development workspace where I build, test, and evolve a real-world backend system connected to a modern **React + Tailwind** frontend.

This project is not just a demo — it is a growing development environment where new features, APIs, and integrations are continuously added as part of my learning and development journey.

The main focus of this repository is the **backend architecture**, API design, database integration, and how a frontend communicates with a backend in real applications.
